# Memetaphor Project
A repository of visual memes appropriate for conveying complex ideas to non-technical audiences. Geared towards the infosec community.

## But why?
Upon entering infosec, it didn't take long for it to become obvious the field on the whole was having a difficult time properly communicating its knowledge & experience to lay audiences—users, management, media, students, *et cetera*.

In my previous academic life, I had researched linguistic anthropology—specifically, the role concrete perceptions play in building conceptual understanding among cultures united by language. The Memetaphor Project's theoretical underpinning is largely inspired by the work of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (i.e., *Metaphors We Live By*, *The Meaning of the Body*, &c) and the subfield of embodied cognition.

So. It occurred to me that it might behoove the field to maintain a central repository of imagery that might better equip infosec professionals to convey highly complex, technical ideas to the lay audiences in need of a greater depth of understanding.

Since I've been personally collecting GIFs and memes used on Twitter and in presentations for a few months now, I figured I might as well make the repository publicly-available online in case anybody else wants to either contribute to the collection or make use of it when it comes to figuring out how to best convey something complex to somebody without the technical background.

## Why are GIFs and memes helpful for conveying unfamiliar complexity?
>“The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another.”
—Lakoff & Johnson, [*Metaphors We Live By*](http://shu.bg/tadmin/upload/storage/161.pdf)

**In a nutshell:** you can transfer a conceptual understanding from a *familiar* context into conceptual understanding of something from an *unfamiliar* context without having to grasp all the particulars of the *unfamiliar* context. (Put another way: it's a way of hacking conceptual understanding.)

So, you want to find something in a familiar, everyday context that adequately describes the dynamic you're trying to convey from a highly specialized, technical context. The most basic and effective method of doing this is by opting for (easily accessible, concrete, visual) metaphors—to convey that (highly specialized, technical) idea. 

**ASIDE:** Although concrete metaphors are not limited to the visual domain, language *does* tend to feature far more visually-based metaphors—but other forms of perception [for instance, an auditory metaphor like “nails on a blackboard”] are perfectly fair game as well; they're just less numerous & harder to use in a PowerPoint. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
